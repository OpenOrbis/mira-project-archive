# The Mira Project

The Mira Project is the result of the hard work from the OpenOrbis team. We believe in quality over quantity releases. There are numerious components to the project and each one will be explained below.

## Components

Here is the list of components with a description of what they do

### Firmware

Previously known as MiraHEN, this has been expanded into a full expansion custom firmware

### Tools

There are many tools included in the Mira project and they are listed out below

#### newlib-ps4

This is the libc implementation ported for PS4. It's a pain in the ass to compile, just take the pre-built binaries seriously.

#### ld-ps4

This is the linker to be used with newlib-ps4 to create Orbis compatible ELF files, or you could use CrazyVoid's elfFixupTool

#### MiraLib

This is the communications library that will be specialized for operation with the Mira firmware.

## User Guide

The users guide is found at USERS.md yamsayin' check it out if you want instructions on how to build, install, and use the firmware once it has been installed on the console with any of the methods described within
