 * This file is the central clearing-house for calendrical issues.
 *
 * In general the kernel does not know about minutes, hours, days, timezones,
 * daylight savings time, leap-years and such.  All that is theoretically a
 * matter for userland only.
 *
 * Parts of kernel code does however care: badly designed filesystems store
 * timestamps in local time and RTC chips sometimes track time in a local
 * timezone instead of UTC and so on.
 *
 * All that code should go here for service.
