 * This implements pools of DMA-able buffers that conserve DMA address space
 * by putting several buffers into one page and that allow to map between
 * 32-bit handles for the buffer and buffer addresses (to use 32-bit network
 * interfaces on 64bit machines). This assists network interfaces that may need
 * huge numbers of mbufs.
