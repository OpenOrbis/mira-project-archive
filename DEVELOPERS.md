# Developers Guide

## Project Layout

At first glance, it may seem like Mira is very complicated, but once you understand the basic layout it is very clear and simple.

* `Tools/` - The tooling folder, which may contain additional libraries and tools to assist with Mira development. These tools are not required to build Mira, but will help developers.
* `Scripts/` - These are general puropse scripts that may get executed automatically by the build, or are there for initializing development environments.
* `Output/` - When configured (by default it's not) will be the output directory for all builds
* `Firmware/` - This directory contains all the components to Mira's core
    * `Dependencies/` - The dependencies for the Mira project, usually just freebsd-headers, and oni-framework
    * `MiraFW/` - The actual source code for Mira, which handles auto-escalation and execution as a background kernel process
    * `Plugins/` - These are all of the *external* plugins that Mira will use. These can be built and compiled independently, and where all developers should create new projects in

## Setting up the development environment

In order to build Mira, you will need either a Windows machine with Visual Studio 2017, the C++ for Linux plugin and Windows Subsystem for Linux (highly recommended), or a linux-based machine/VM with the `build-essentials` package installed (gcc, clang, etc).

### Windows Setup

This is recommended way to develop for Mira. Since Mira is developed using Unix Makefiles, there is a direct compatibility with the Windows and Linux development environments.

1. [Download & Install](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) Visual Studio 2017 WITH the [C++ for Linux support](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2017/04/11/linux-development-with-c-in-visual-studio/)
2. [Enable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) the Windows Subsystem for Linux
    1. You will need to configure the newly created WSL environment's ssh daemon.
    2. This can be done by editing `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` on most platforms.
        * You will need to change the port number to 2222 as Windows 10 may use port 22 for other reasons
3. Configure Windows Firewall to allow port 2222 on LAN (**_LAN ONLY OR LOCALHOST ONLY_**)
4. Configure Visual Studio's remote targets to use `localhost` port 2222 as the port number and your username/password created during the WSL install screen
    * If there's a red box error use `127.0.0.1` as the IP address 
5. Open the `Mira.sln` with Visual Studio 2017 and do a full rebuild, this should deploy the [freebsd-headers](https://github.com/OpenOrbis/freebsd-headers) and [modified oni-framework](https://github.com/OpenOrbis/oni-framework)

### Linux Setup

Linux setup has now been made easy thanks to the script `Scripts/init_development_environment.sh`. Running this script will export necessary environment variables, create needed directories, and ultimately build Mira. The script will also prompt you for a firmware option, allowing you to easily setup Mira for whichever firmware you need. **This should only be ran once, for building after installation, see the "Building the project" sub-section for Linux.**

```
$ cd Scripts
$ ./init_development_environment.sh
Please choose a firmware:
        [0] 5.01 Firmware
        [1] 5.05 Firmware
Option?
```

### Cloning the project

No matter if you are using Windows or Linux, these commands will be the same.

* If you are on Windows, you *MUST* clone inside of WSL and not within Windows itself
    * You can access all Windows partitions from within WSL by navigating to `/mnt/{windows drive letter}` (ex: `/mnt/c/Users/example/Desktop`)

1. Clone the repository
    * `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/OpenOrbis/mira-project.git`
2. (Linux Users Only) Create all needed directories
    * Windows users using the Mira.sln, this will automatically get done for you when you do a Rebuild all on the solution.
    * `cd mira-project/Firmware/Dependencies/oni-framework`
    * `make create`
    * `cd ../../MiraFW`
    * `make create`

## Building the project

### Windows
In Visual Studio, there are three core projects in the solution. They are as follows:
1. freebsd-headers
2. oni-framework
3. MiraFW

##### freebsd-headers
This project should only need to be built once. Note that copying the sources remotely may take a while.

##### oni-framework
Most of the time, this project also only needs to be built once unless you're editing the framework. If you're creating plugins, you don't need to edit the framework.

##### MiraFW
If you edited Mira's core / core plugins, you will need to rebuild this project. The previous two projects must be built in order at least once or MiraFW will fail to build.

### Linux
The installation script `Scripts/init_development_environment.sh` will setup directories and build. To build after setup, you need only to build what you've changed. If you've only edited parts of Mira, you do not need to rebuild `oni-framework`. The build instructions for both are below:

##### oni-framework
```
cd Firmware/Dependencies/oni-framework
make clean
make
```

##### MiraFW
```
cd Firmware/MiraFW
make clean
make
```

The output files by default will be labelled `MiraFW_Orbis.bin` and `MiraFW_Orbis.elf` inside the `Firmware/MiraFW` directory. `MiraFW_Orbis.bin` is the payload you want to send to your PS4. 

## Contribution
In the past, contributing to Mira was kind of a free-for-all. Code was getting commited that was untested, and there were conflictions. To solve this issue, Mira now has a proper pipeline for development. There are three main branches now - these branches are the following:

`master` - Stable branch
`testing` - Beta branch
`vNext` - Alpha branch

When forking the repo to work on features, you should now work off of the `vNext` branch. This is like the alpha stage of development. When a feature is completed and ready for testing, it will be merged into the `testing` branch, where it will be tested by Mira verified testers on Mira's supported platforms.

Finally, after your code has been tested by Mira's verified testers and has been vetted by a Mira developer, your code may be processed into the master branch.
