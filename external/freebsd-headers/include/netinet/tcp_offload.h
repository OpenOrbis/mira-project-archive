/*
 * A driver publishes that it provides offload services
 * by setting IFCAP_TOE in the ifnet. The offload connect
 * will bypass any further work if the interface that a
 * connection would use does not support TCP offload.
 *
 * The TOE API assumes that the tcp offload engine can offload the 
 * the entire connection from set up to teardown, with some provision 
 * being made to allowing the software stack to handle time wait. If
 * the device does not meet these criteria, it is the driver's responsibility
 * to overload the functions that it needs to in tcp_usrreqs and make
 * its own calls to tcp_output if it needs to do so.
 *
 * There is currently no provision for the device advertising the congestion
 * control algorithms it supports as there is currently no API for querying 
 * an operating system for the protocols that it has loaded. This is a desirable
 * future extension.
 *
 *
 *
 * It is assumed that individuals deploying TOE will want connections
 * to be offloaded without software changes so all connections on an
 * interface providing TOE are offloaded unless the SO_NO_OFFLOAD 
 * flag is set on the socket.
 *
 *
 * The toe_usrreqs structure constitutes the TOE driver's 
 * interface to the TCP stack for functionality that doesn't
 * interact directly with userspace. If one wants to provide
 * (optional) functionality to do zero-copy to/from
 * userspace one still needs to override soreceive/sosend 
 * with functions that fault in and pin the user buffers.
 *
 * + tu_send
 *   - tells the driver that new data may have been added to the 
 *     socket's send buffer - the driver should not fail if the
 *     buffer is in fact unchanged
 *   - the driver is responsible for providing credits (bytes in the send window)
 *     back to the socket by calling sbdrop() as segments are acknowledged.
 *   - The driver expects the inpcb lock to be held - the driver is expected
 *     not to drop the lock. Hence the driver is not allowed to acquire the
 *     pcbinfo lock during this call.
 *
 * + tu_rcvd
 *   - returns credits to the driver and triggers window updates
 *     to the peer (a credit as used here is a byte in the peer's receive window)
 *   - the driver is expected to determine how many bytes have been 
 *     consumed and credit that back to the card so that it can grow
 *     the window again by maintaining its own state between invocations.
 *   - In principle this could be used to shrink the window as well as
 *     grow the window, although it is not used for that now.
 *   - this function needs to correctly handle being called any number of
 *     times without any bytes being consumed from the receive buffer.
 *   - The driver expects the inpcb lock to be held - the driver is expected
 *     not to drop the lock. Hence the driver is not allowed to acquire the
 *     pcbinfo lock during this call.
 *
 * + tu_disconnect
 *   - tells the driver to send FIN to peer
 *   - driver is expected to send the remaining data and then do a clean half close
 *   - disconnect implies at least half-close so only send, reset, and detach
 *     are legal
 *   - the driver is expected to handle transition through the shutdown
 *     state machine and allow the stack to support SO_LINGER.
 *   - The driver expects the inpcb lock to be held - the driver is expected
 *     not to drop the lock. Hence the driver is not allowed to acquire the
 *     pcbinfo lock during this call.
 *
 * + tu_reset
 *   - closes the connection and sends a RST to peer
 *   - driver is expectd to trigger an RST and detach the toepcb
 *   - no further calls are legal after reset
 *   - The driver expects the inpcb lock to be held - the driver is expected
 *     not to drop the lock. Hence the driver is not allowed to acquire the
 *     pcbinfo lock during this call.
 *
 *   The following fields in the tcpcb are expected to be referenced by the driver:
 *	+ iss
 *	+ rcv_nxt
 *	+ rcv_wnd
 *	+ snd_isn
 *	+ snd_max
 *	+ snd_nxt
 *	+ snd_una
 *	+ t_flags
 *	+ t_inpcb
 *	+ t_maxseg
 *	+ t_toe
 *
 *   The following fields in the inpcb are expected to be referenced by the driver:
 *	+ inp_lport
 *	+ inp_fport
 *	+ inp_laddr
 *	+ inp_fport
 *	+ inp_socket
 *	+ inp_ip_tos
 *
 *   The following fields in the socket are expected to be referenced by the
 *   driver:
 *	+ so_comp
 *	+ so_error
 *	+ so_linger
 *	+ so_options
 *	+ so_rcv
 *	+ so_snd
 *	+ so_state
 *	+ so_timeo
 *
 *   These functions all return 0 on success and can return the following errors
 *   as appropriate:
 *	+ EPERM:
 *	+ ENOBUFS: memory allocation failed
 *	+ EMSGSIZE: MTU changed during the call
 *	+ EHOSTDOWN:
 *	+ EHOSTUNREACH:
 *	+ ENETDOWN:
 *	* ENETUNREACH: the peer is no longer reachable
 *
 * + tu_detach
 *   - tells driver that the socket is going away so disconnect
 *     the toepcb and free appropriate resources
 *   - allows the driver to cleanly handle the case of connection state
 *     outliving the socket
 *   - no further calls are legal after detach
 *   - the driver is expected to provide its own synchronization between
 *     detach and receiving new data.
 * 
 * + tu_syncache_event
 *   - even if it is not actually needed, the driver is expected to
 *     call syncache_add for the initial SYN and then syncache_expand
 *     for the SYN,ACK
 *   - tells driver that a connection either has not been added or has 
 *     been dropped from the syncache
 *   - the driver is expected to maintain state that lives outside the 
 *     software stack so the syncache needs to be able to notify the
 *     toe driver that the software stack is not going to create a connection
 *     for a received SYN
 *   - The driver is responsible for any synchronization required between
 *     the syncache dropping an entry and the driver processing the SYN,ACK.
