/*
 * The pcb_flags is only modified by current thread, or by other threads
 * when current thread is stopped.  However, current thread may change it
 * from the interrupt context in cpu_switch(), or in the trap handler.
 * When we read-modify-write pcb_flags from C sources, compiler may generate
 * code that is not atomic regarding the interrupt handler.  If a trap or
 * interrupt happens and any flag is modified from the handler, it can be
 * clobbered with the cached value later.  Therefore, we implement setting
 * and clearing flags with single-instruction functions, which do not race
 * with possible modification of the flags from the trap or interrupt context,
 * because traps and interrupts are executed only on instruction boundary.
