 * Lock classes.  Each lock has a class which describes characteristics
 * common to all types of locks of a given class.
 *
 * Spin locks in general must always protect against preemption, as it is
 * an error to perform any type of context switch while holding a spin lock.
 * Also, for an individual lock to be recursable, its class must allow
 * recursion and the lock itself must explicitly allow recursion.
 *
 * The 'lc_ddb_show' function pointer is used to dump class-specific
 * data for the 'show lock' DDB command.  The 'lc_lock' and
 * 'lc_unlock' function pointers are used in sleep(9) and cv_wait(9)
 * to lock and unlock locks while blocking on a sleep queue.  The
 * return value of 'lc_unlock' will be passed to 'lc_lock' on resume
 * to allow communication of state between the two routines.
