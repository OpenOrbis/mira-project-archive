/*
 * Sleep queue interface.  Sleep/wakeup, condition variables, and sx
 * locks use a sleep queue for the queue of threads blocked on a sleep
 * channel.
 *
 * A thread calls sleepq_lock() to lock the sleep queue chain associated
 * with a given wait channel.  A thread can then call call sleepq_add() to
 * add themself onto a sleep queue and call one of the sleepq_wait()
 * functions to actually go to sleep.  If a thread needs to abort a sleep
 * operation it should call sleepq_release() to unlock the associated sleep
 * queue chain lock.  If the thread also needs to remove itself from a queue
 * it just enqueued itself on, it can use sleepq_remove() instead.
 *
 * If the thread only wishes to sleep for a limited amount of time, it can
 * call sleepq_set_timeout() after sleepq_add() to setup a timeout.  It
 * should then use one of the sleepq_timedwait() functions to block.
 *
 * If the thread wants the sleep to be interruptible by signals, it can
 * call sleepq_catch_signals() after sleepq_add().  It should then use
 * one of the sleepq_wait_sig() functions to block.  After the thread has
 * been resumed, it should call sleepq_calc_signal_retval() to determine
 * if it should return EINTR or ERESTART passing in the value returned from
 * the earlier call to sleepq_catch_signals().
 *
 * A thread is normally resumed from a sleep queue by either the
 * sleepq_signal() or sleepq_broadcast() functions.  Sleepq_signal() wakes
 * the thread with the highest priority that is sleeping on the specified
 * wait channel.  Sleepq_broadcast() wakes all threads that are sleeping
 * on the specified wait channel.  A thread sleeping in an interruptible
 * sleep can be interrupted by calling sleepq_abort().  A thread can also
 * be removed from a specified sleep queue using the sleepq_remove()
 * function.  Note that the sleep queue chain must first be locked via
 * sleepq_lock() before calling sleepq_abort(), sleepq_broadcast(), or
 * sleepq_signal().  These routines each return a boolean that will be true
 * if at least one swapped-out thread was resumed.  In that case, the caller
 * is responsible for waking up the swapper by calling kick_proc0() after
 * releasing the sleep queue chain lock.
 *
 * Each thread allocates a sleep queue at thread creation via sleepq_alloc()
 * and releases it at thread destruction via sleepq_free().  Note that
 * a sleep queue is not tied to a specific thread and that the sleep queue
 * released at thread destruction may not be the same sleep queue that the
 * thread allocated when it was created.
 *
 * XXX: Some other parts of the kernel such as ithread sleeping may end up
 * using this interface as well (death to TDI_IWAIT!)
